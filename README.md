🛍️ Brazilian E-Commerce Comprehensive Business Analysis

📌 Project Overview
This project provides a 360-degree view of a major Brazilian E-Commerce ecosystem, analyzing over 96,000 orders and 33,000 unique products. Using Power BI, I transformed raw transactional data into a strategic tool that identifies top revenue drivers, customer purchasing behavior, and logistics performance across 4,119 cities.

📊 Key Insights
Revenue Powerhouses: The "Housewares" and "Telephony" categories are the primary revenue drivers, contributing over $2.4M in combined sales.

Purchasing Patterns: A significant majority of transactions (77.2%) occur during the weekdays, suggesting a professional or routine-based purchasing habit among the customer base.

Logistics & Shipping: Identified a major variance in shipping efficiency, with "Arts and Crafts" boasting the fastest delivery times (5.39 days) compared to "Security and Services" (15 days).

Geographical Density: The interactive map highlights a high concentration of sellers in major metropolitan hubs, identifying potential underserved regions for market expansion.

Customer Loyalty: Analyzed the top 5 revenue-generating customers, with the leading segment contributing nearly 33% of top-tier revenue.

🛠️ Technical Toolkit
Business Intelligence: Designed a high-impact executive dashboard in Power BI utilizing a cohesive blue-and-white professional theme.

Geospatial Analysis: Integrated ESRI Maps to visualize seller distribution across South and North American regions.

Advanced Data Visualization:

Funnel Charts: To visualize and compare shipping lead times across categories.

Donut & Pie Charts: For quick-glance distribution of weekday vs. weekend revenue.

Multi-Row Cards: To highlight high-level KPIs like Average Price ($121) and Total Cities (4,119).

Data Modeling: Structured a complex dataset involving customers, sellers, products, and logistics into an efficient reporting model.
